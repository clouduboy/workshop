Clouduboy
---------

[Clouduboy](https://clouduboy.org) is the collective name of some open-source
tooling for creating HTML5 Canvas indie retro pixelart games using web technologies
and then putting them onto tiny custom-built Arduino pocket-game-consoles.

MicroCanvas
-----------

[MicroCanvas](https://github.com/clouduboy/microcanvas) is a library for creating
web pixelart games using the HTML5 Canvas.
It uses the [PixelData](https://github.com/clouduboy/microcanvas-pixeldata/) image
library format to make it easier creating simple pixelgraphic art without an
external application.
